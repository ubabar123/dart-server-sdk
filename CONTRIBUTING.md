Here’s the updated **README** tailored for **Open Feature** and GitHub:

## **Development**

### **Installation and Dependencies**

Install dependencies with:
```bash
dart pub get
```

We aim to minimize runtime dependencies. Please review new dependencies carefully and follow Dart's best practices when proposing additions.

### **Testing**

We use an extensive suite of automated tests to ensure quality and reliability. Contributors must include appropriate tests for new features or bug fixes. Automated GitHub workflows will validate changes during pull requests.

#### **Testing Overview**

| **Test Type**            | **Description**                                                                                             | **Command**                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Unit Tests**           | Validates individual components in isolation using mocks and fakes.                                       | `dart test`                     |
| **Integration Tests**    | Validates interactions between components and external systems like Firebase.                            | `make integration-test`         |
| **End-to-End Tests**     | Simulates real-world workflows across the system using Gherkin-based test harness.                       | `make e2e-test`                 |
| **Mutation Tests**       | Ensures robustness of test coverage by introducing controlled code mutations.                            | `dart run mutest`               |
| **Static Analysis**      | Ensures code adheres to guidelines and highlights potential bugs.                                        | `dart analyze`                  |
| **Code Coverage**        | Ensures critical paths are covered with tests, generates LCOV reports.                                  | `dart test --coverage=coverage` |

#### **Unit Tests**

Run unit tests with:
```bash
dart test
```

#### **End-to-End Tests**

Our CI pipeline executes Gherkin-based end-to-end tests. To run them locally:

1. Pull the `test-harness` git submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Execute the tests:
   ```bash
   make e2e-test
   ```

#### **Mutation Testing**

Validate the robustness of your test suite using mutation tests:
```bash
dart run mutest
```

## **Branching and Commit Guidelines**

### **Branch Naming Conventions**

Follow these conventions when creating branches for pull requests:
```
<type>/<branch-name>
```

| **Branch Type** | **Purpose**                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`          | For new features under development. Example: `feat/add-auth-module`.                                |
| `fix`           | For bug fixes. Example: `fix/login-error`.                                                          |
| `hotfix`        | For urgent production fixes requiring immediate attention. Example: `hotfix/critical-db-error`.     |
| `chore`         | For maintenance tasks, such as dependency updates or refactoring. Example: `chore/update-dependencies`. |
| `release`       | For preparing release branches with versioned changes. Example: `release/v1.2.0`.                   |
| `test`          | For testing-related changes, such as adding or modifying test cases. Example: `test/add-unit-tests`.|

---

### **Examples**

| **Type**          | **Example Branch Name**            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| `feat`            | `feat/add-user-auth`               |
| `fix`             | `fix/payment-gateway-bug`          |
| `hotfix`          | `hotfix/critical-db-error`         |
| `chore`           | `chore/upgrade-dependencies`       |
| `test`            | `test/add-integration-tests`       |
| `release`         | `release/v1.2.0`                   |

---

### **Commit Message Format**

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) to ensure clear and consistent commit history.  

**Commit types are aligned with branch naming conventions** to maintain consistency across the workflow.

#### **Commit Structure**

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
<BLANK LINE>
[optional body]
<BLANK LINE>
[optional footer(s)]
```

| **Type**      | **Branch Equivalent**  | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`        | `feat`                 | Adds a new feature. Example: `feat(auth): add OAuth 2.0 support`.              |
| `fix`         | `fix`                  | Fixes a bug. Example: `fix(payment): resolve rounding error`.                  |
| `hotfix`      | `hotfix`               | Urgent fixes for production. Example: `hotfix(db): resolve connection issue`.  |
| `chore`       | `chore`                | Maintenance tasks or refactoring. Example: `chore(deps): update dependencies`. |
| `test`        | `test`                 | Adds or updates tests. Example: `test(api): add integration tests`.            |
| `refactor`    | `refactor`             | Code restructuring without functional changes. Example: `refactor(ui): improve layout`. |
| `release`     | `release`              | Prepares a versioned release. Example: `release: v1.2.0`.                      |

#### **Best Practices**

1. **Align Commit Type with Branch Type**:
   - A branch like `feat/add-auth-module` should include commits starting with `feat:`.
   - A branch like `fix/login-error` should include commits starting with `fix:`.

2. **Use Scope (Optional)**:
   - Add a scope in parentheses to specify the module or component affected.
   - Examples: `feat(auth)`, `fix(payment)`, `test(ui)`.

3. **Write a Clear Summary**:
   - Use the imperative mood for the summary (e.g., "add", "fix", not "added" or "fixed").

4. **Add Context in the Body (Optional)**:
   - Provide additional details or reasoning for the change.

5. **Reference Issues or PRs in the Footer**:
   - Use the footer for links to related issues or PRs and to indicate breaking changes.
   - Examples:
     ```plaintext
     Fixes #123
     BREAKING CHANGE: Deprecated legacy login endpoints.
     ```

### **Branching Rules and Protection**

To maintain consistency and ensure stability, we enforce the following **branch protection rules**:

#### **Protected Branches**
- **Branches**: `main`, `qa`, `beta`
- **Rules**:
  - Direct **pushes** are not allowed.
  - Changes must go through a **pull request** and pass all required checks before merging.
  - At least **1 reviewer** must approve pull requests.
  - Status checks:
    - **Branch name validation** must pass.
    - **Commit message validation** must pass.
    - Relevant workflows (e.g., `main-workflow`, `qa-workflow`) must pass.

#### **Unprotected Branches**
- Feature and other short-lived branches (e.g., `feat/add-auth`, `fix/login-error`) are not protected.
- Contributors can push directly to these branches.

#### **Branch Lifecycle**
- **Feature, Fix, Hotfix, Test Branches**:
  - Created by developers for specific tasks.
  - Merged into `main`, `qa`, or `beta` branches through pull requests.
  - Deleted after merging.

### **How It Works**

1. **Contributors Create Feature Branches**:
   - Example: `feat/add-user-auth`.
   - Pushes to these branches are allowed without restrictions.

2. **Pull Requests into Protected Branches**:
   - Protected branches (`main`, `qa`, `beta`) require pull requests.
   - Pull requests trigger workflows for testing and validation.

3. **Validation on Push and Pull Requests**:
   - Branch name and commit message validations are run on all branches during pushes.
   - Protected branches also enforce workflow checks and reviews.
